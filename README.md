# Devious League: Cobblemon Minecraft Server
Resource files and setup for Devious League Cobblemon Minecraft Server.
IP Address: deviousleague.playmc.at

## Features
- Minimap.
- Chest protection.
- Proximity voice chat.
- Pokepedia guidebook.
- Allows cracked players to join.
- Furniture items for home needs.
- Tons of Fakemon made by the community.
- Some unreleased Pokemon not available in the mod yet.

## Requirements
- Minecraft Fabric 1.19.2 (https://maven.fabricmc.net/net/fabricmc/fabric-installer/0.11.2/fabric-installer-0.11.2.exe)
- The mod pack in this repository.
- The server's resource pack.

## How to play?
1. Install Fabric. Make sure it's in Client tab > 1.19.2. DO NOT touch the loader version. Click install once you're ready.
2. Extract the mod pack available in the Releases tab into C:\Users\XXX\AppData\Roaming.minecraft\mods. (or any other destination folder you install Minecraft in.)
4. Launch Minecraft Fabric 1.19.2 shown in the Launcher and connect with the IP.
5. You should be downloading the resource pack automatically upon joining as well. If you don't see any changes, you can manually download the resource pack available in the Releases tab.
- WARNING: MAKE SURE ALL OF YOUR PREVIOUS MODS ARE MOVED OUT OF YOUR .minecraft/mods FOLDER. OTHERWISE, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO JOIN THE SERVER. DO NOT MAKE SUBFOLDERS AND KEEP THE FILES INDIVIDUALLY AS JARS. THE SERVER ALSO DOES NOT SUPPORT FORGE.

## Common Troubleshooting
I keep getting kicked out immediately after I joined!
- If you join the server and immediately get kicked, it's the modpack issue. If you're not sure, clear ALL of the mods out of the folder and then extract the files again.

I keep getting kicked out after downloading the resource pack! Before that I was teleported into the void. (internal exception java.net.socketexception)
- You have a connection issue. You have to manually check out the steps in this video here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYGZdKOV2fs
